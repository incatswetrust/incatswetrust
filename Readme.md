Hi 👋 
I’m a full-stack developer with strong backend focus and hands-on experience in building production-ready systems:
web applications, APIs, automation tools, integrations, and internal platforms.

I work across the full lifecycle, from system design and architecture to implementation, deployment, and long-term maintenance.

## Technologies & Tools

### Backend
- **C# / .NET**: ASP.NET Core (Web API), Blazor, Razor Pages  
- **PHP**: Laravel  
- **Python**: Django  
- **Node.js**: Express  

Focus areas:
- API-first architecture
- complex business logic
- authentication & authorization
- background jobs and automation
- integrations with third-party services

---

### Frontend
- **TypeScript**
- **Svelte / SvelteKit**
- **HTML / CSS**
- **Tailwind CSS**, Bootstrap

I usually treat frontend as a system interface: clear state, predictable data flow, minimal visual noise.

### Desktop / Native UI
**Windows**
- Avalonia UI (AXAML)
- WPF (XAML)
- WinForms (including custom UI libraries)

**macOS**
- Swift (native applications)

- Cloudflare (DNS, proxying, basic security)

**CI/CD**
- GitHub Actions
- Vercel

I regularly handle:

### Integrations & Automation

  - Telegram Web Apps
  - client-side flows and callbacks
